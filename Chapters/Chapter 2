Chapter Two

On this particular day, the sun seemed to be playing a lazy game of hide and seek, casting dancing shadows across the forest floor as it hung low in the sky. The golden rays filtered through the canopy of the Whispering Woods, creating a kaleidoscope of vibrant hues where they kissed the earth. 

Corin Shadowblade was a mere silhouette amidst this breathtaking spectacle of nature. He was dressed in a well-worn green tunic that blended into the surroundings, making him seem like an integral part of the Whispering Woods. He belonged here; these woods had always been his sanctuary from the burdens of the world.

He idly toyed with a small stick and a pocketknife, hands skillfully whittling the wood into an intricate shape. Lost in thought, his eyes traced the patterns of sunlight, his youthful face tilted upward, the twinkle in his blue eyes reflecting his dreamy aspirations. 

"If only I were an Ethernode," he sighed, envious of those blessed with the ability to manipulate ethereal energy. His imagination ran wild, painting vivid images of himself in grand adventures - casting powerful spells, brewing magical potions, facing fearsome adversaries, and triumphing with a flick of his wrist.

And then his fantasies took a different turn. Maybe he could be an explorer, an adventurer, just like the ones in the tales his father spun. He could practically feel the chill of the mountain winds against his skin as he scaled perilous peaks, the thrill of unearthing ancient relics buried deep in the sands of time, the awe of discovering lost cities in the heart of vast, unending deserts.

His mind was so preoccupied with these grand illusions that he hardly noticed the obstacle in his path. His foot caught on a protruding root, and he stumbled forward, letting out a surprised yelp. His hands instinctively reached out, the whittled stick brandished as if it were a wand. He laughed at his own silliness, shaking his head at his vivid imagination.

"Vibratium leviosa," he declared playfully, echoing the incantations from the Ethernode's handbook. But instead of fading away like a whispered dream, something in the world responded. A small rock near the tree root began to tremble, and then - it lifted off the ground.

The air seemed to solidify, time grinding to a halt as Corin watched the levitating rock with wide, incredulous eyes. An ethereal light burst forth from the stick in his hand, enveloping the rock and casting eerie shadows against the forest floor. He felt a ripple of energy through his arm, sending a shiver down his spine.

With a trembling hand, he reached out to the suspended stone. As his fingers brushed against it, he felt an indescribable sensation of power - a pulsating, living energy that responded to his touch. It was equal parts exhilarating and terrifying. The stone moved at his will, as if obeying a command from the very depths of his being. "Has the Ethernode's power chosen me?" He wondered aloud, his voice barely a whisper amidst the rustling leaves.

This newfound power intrigued Corin and stirred an irresistible urge to explore its limits. He began with small, seemingly inconsequential things - a fallen leaf, a discarded twig, a cluster of pebbles. Each object yielded to his will, lifting and floating under the influence of his previously unknown power. 


His heart pounded with excitement and fear. The tales he'd heard as a child about the Ethernodes suddenly felt real and personal. Yet there was something else, a nagging worry that etched its way into his newfound joy. How was he, a simple boy from a humble background, gifted with this unimaginable power? And, more importantly, what was expected of him now?

Corin gazed at the ethereal light illuminating the forest around him, its glow turning the familiar Whispering Woods into a place of magic and mystery. His adventure was about to begin, whether he was ready or not.
