Chapter Three

The first golden rays of sunlight kissed the rooftops of Vernian, casting a warm glow on the cobblestone streets. The village was slowly coming to life, but an unusual stillness hung in the air as if it sensed the arrival of a stranger.

Seraphine glided through the village like a specter, her hooded cloak concealing her features. Her ethereal presence went largely unnoticed by the villagers, who were too preoccupied with their daily tasks to pay her any mind. However, she had not come for them. She sought a different quarry—one whose very existence would shake the foundations of their world.

"Corin Shadowblade," Seraphine whispered under her breath as she approached the modest dwelling nestled at the edge of town. The name alone sent a shiver down her spine, for it was said to be connected to an ancient prophecy—one that spoke of a hero who would bring about a new era of peace and balance.

From within the house, Corin sat hunched over his breakfast, completely unaware of the visitor at his doorstep. His thoughts were consumed by the strange events that had been unfolding of late: the odd dreams, the mysterious voices, and the inexplicable energy he seemed to now wield. He couldn't put a finger on what it all meant, but the nagging feeling that it was somehow linked to the stories about the Ethernodes persisted.

"Who's there?" Corin called out, sensing a disturbance outside. Seraphine didn't answer, but instead pushed open the door and slipped into the room like a wraith. The teenager tensed, his hand instinctively reaching for the knife that lay on the table beside him.

"Be at ease, young one," Seraphine murmured, pulling back her hood to reveal her face. Her eyes held an otherworldly beauty, captivating Corin despite the fear that gripped him. "My name is Seraphine, and I come bearing a message from the Ethereal Council."

"Wh-what do they want with me?" Corin stammered, his grip on the knife tightening.

"Ah," Seraphine replied, her voice lilting like a silken melody. "Now that is a tale best told in its entirety. But first, tell me: have you ever heard of the Ethernodes?"

Corin hesitated, recalling the stories he read about the legendary beings who could wield ethereal energies. "Yes… but what does that have to do with me?"

"Everything," she said simply. "You see, it is believed that you possess the same abilities as those fabled heroes—the power to manipulate the very essence of magic itself."

"Me? But that's impossible!" Corin exclaimed, his heart pounding in his chest. He had felt it before, coursing through him like a tempest, but how did she know about what happened in the wood.

"Is it, though?" Seraphine challenged, her gaze piercing into the very depths of his soul. "The signs are all there, young one. The dreams, the ethereal energy that courses through your veins. You cannot deny the truth any longer."

"How does she know about the dreams?", He thought.

"Even if it's true," Corin said cautiously, "what am I supposed to do with this power?"

"Learn," Seraphine replied. "Grow. Embrace it, and become the person you were always meant to be."

"Corin, I have been observing you for some time now," Seraphine said, her words carrying the weight of a thousand whispers. "I have seen the ethereal energies dance at your fingertips, and I know that you are capable of much more than you could ever imagine."

The moonlight cast an ethereal glow on Seraphine's face, making her otherworldly features even more captivating. Corin's breath caught in his throat as he considered her words, the wind rustling through the leaves above them like the hushed voices of ancient spirits.

"I-I don't understand," he stammered, heart pounding with the realization that someone else knew his secret. And yet, part of him couldn't deny the magnetic pull of her presence, the allure of becoming something greater than himself—maybe even an Ethernode.

"Think back to your adventures in the Whispering Woods," she prompted gently, her eyes reflecting the glittering constellations overhead. "When the trees seemed to bend to your will, and the very air crackled with energy. You were tapping into something powerful, Corin. Something that few others can even begin to comprehend."

Corin's mind raced as he recalled those strange occurrences. The way the shadows had seemed to shift around him, the inexplicable sense of connection he'd felt with the world itself. It was both exhilarating and terrifying, but he had never dared to speak of it aloud until now.

"Perhaps…" he admitted hesitantly, feeling a shiver run down his spine. "But if this power is real, then what does that mean for my life here in Vernian?"

"Your life has already begun to change," Seraphine answered softly, though her words held a note of steel. "You cannot remain in ignorance of your true potential, nor can you ignore the call that destiny has placed upon your shoulders."

As Corin considered her words, the familiar sights and sounds of Vernian seemed to fade away, replaced by an overwhelming sense of possibility—and fear. The path before him stretched out into the unknown, filled with potential dangers he could never have anticipated.

"Can I… can I ever go back to being just a normal boy?" he asked, his voice barely audible above the rustling leaves.

"Once you have tasted the power of ethereal magic, there is no going back," Seraphine replied, her gaze unwavering. "But that does not mean you will lose everything you hold dear. It simply means that your life will take on a new purpose, one that is greater than anything you could have imagined."

Corin looked down at his hands, feeling the weight of this revelation settle upon him like a mantle. In his heart, he knew that Seraphine was right—there was no turning back now. But as the shadows lengthened around them and the first stars began to appear in the sky above, he couldn't help but wonder what the future held for him, and whether he was truly ready for the challenges that lay ahead.

The sun had dipped below the horizon, leaving only remnants of its fiery hues to fade into the encroaching blue-black of night. The gentle rustle of leaves and distant whispers of village life surrounded Corin and Seraphine as they sat on a low stone wall, marking the boundary between Vernian and the vast expanse of wilderness that lay beyond.

"Corin," Seraphine began, her voice soft, but with an underlying intensity that demanded his attention. She turned to face him, silver eyes sparkling in the twilight. "I have a proposition for you—one that will require you to leave Vernian."

"Leave...?" Corin echoed, trying to keep his emotions in check. He felt a mix of wonder and trepidation at what she might ask of him.

"Vernian has been a safe haven for you, but it cannot provide what you need to grow into your full potential." Seraphine paused, watching his face carefully. "I want you to accompany me to Luminara, the City of Light, where you can learn to master your abilities and become a true Ethernode."

Corin's breath caught in his throat at the mention of Luminara. He had heard tales of the legendary city, described as an ethereal oasis nestled within a hidden valley. Its towering spires shimmered with a pale golden glow, casting their light upon the ancient streets paved with lustrous white stones. It was said that the air itself hummed with the pulse of ethereal energy, and that those who walked its paths were forever changed by the knowledge that flowed through its hallowed halls.

"Is... is that even possible? For someone like me?" Corin asked, unable to fully grasp the magnitude of her offer. To leave the familiar comfort of his home, family, and friends was a daunting prospect, but the allure of unlocking the secrets of his newfound powers was almost irresistible.

"More than possible, it is necessary," Seraphine replied, her voice firm but gentle. "You have a rare gift, Corin—one that must be nurtured and honed if you are to fulfill your destiny."

Corin stared down at his hands, the same hands that had unwittingly unleashed a torrent of ethereal energy in the Whispering Woods mere days ago. The thought of harnessing that power, of learning to control it and use it for some greater purpose, both thrilled and terrified him.

"Think about it, Corin," Seraphine continued. Her eyes held a depth of understanding that seemed to see into his very soul. "This is not a decision to be made lightly, but I believe it is one you were always meant to make."

"Will... will I ever be able to return?" Corin asked hesitantly, imagining the faces of his family and friends, the people he would be leaving behind.

"Perhaps," Seraphine said softly. "But know that the path of an Ethernode is not an easy one—nor is it one that allows for much attachment to the mundane world."

As the first stars began to twinkle in the deepening night sky, Corin weighed the gravity of Seraphine's offer. The chance to become something greater than himself, to learn the secrets of the ancient city of Luminara, battled against the love and loyalty he felt for Vernian and the life he had always known.

The cool breeze of the night carried with it the scent of damp earth and dew-covered leaves, grounding Corin in the familiar surroundings of Vernian. As he gazed into the starlit sky, his mind raced through a torrent of memories and emotions.

"Corin," Seraphine said softly as she prepared to leave him to his thoughts, "remember, I'll be waiting for your decision at the edge of the village at dawn."

"Thank you, Seraphine," he replied, struggling to keep his voice steady.

Once she was gone, Corin let out a deep breath, trying to untangle the complex web of thoughts that filled his mind. On one hand, he felt an undeniable attraction to the idea of becoming an Ethernode, a being capable of manipulating ethereal energies. It was like something from the stories he had read, and part of him longed to be part of that legend.

"Imagine what I could achieve," he whispered to himself, picturing the awe-inspiring City of Light and the ancient wisdom contained within its walls. The prospect of exploring life beyond Vernian, pushing the boundaries of his own abilities and potential, sent a thrill down his spine.

Yet, for all its allure, the unknown world beyond Vernian also filled him with trepidation. He knew that once he stepped onto the path of an Ethernode, there would be no turning back. The dangers he might face—both in mastering his powers and in confronting whatever destiny awaited him—loomed large in his thoughts.

"Is it worth risking everything?" he pondered. A sudden gust of wind rustled the branches above, as if whispering their own doubts and fears.

As he considered the faces of those he loved—his family, his best friend, Jonah—he felt a heaviness settle upon his shoulders. Leaving them behind would not only mean giving up the safety and comfort of his home, but also the bonds that had shaped him into the person he was.

"Can I truly abandon them?" his heart ached at the thought. "What if... what if I can't protect them from whatever dangers my new life might bring?"

The stars above seemed to shimmer with a silent understanding, offering no answers but bearing witness to his inner turmoil. Corin clenched his fists, hoping that somehow, amid the swirling emotions and uncertainties, he would find the strength and clarity to make the decision that would change his life forever.

As the night deepened and the first light of dawn began to paint the horizon, Corin sat alone beneath the ancient oak tree, lost in his thoughts. The weight of the choice before him pressed heavily upon his chest, as if the entire world waited with bated breath for his answer.

"Who am I meant to be?" he asked the silent stars. And in that moment of stillness, Corin knew that only he could decide the path his destiny would take.
