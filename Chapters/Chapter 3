Chapter Three

The first golden rays of sunlight kissed the rooftops of Vernian, casting a warm glow on the cobblestone streets. The village was slowly coming to life, but an unusual stillness hung in the air as if it sensed the arrival of a stranger.

Seraphine glided through the village like a specter, her hooded cloak concealing her features. Her ethereal presence went largely unnoticed by the villagers, who were too preoccupied with their daily tasks to pay her any mind. However, she had not come for them. She sought a different quarry—one whose very existence would shake the foundations of their world.

"Corin Shadowblade," Seraphine whispered under her breath as she approached the modest dwelling nestled at the edge of town. The name alone sent a shiver down her spine, for it was said to be connected to an ancient prophecy—one that spoke of a hero who would bring about a new era of peace and balance.

From within the house, Corin sat hunched over his breakfast, completely unaware of the visitor at his doorstep. His thoughts were consumed by the strange events that had been unfolding of late: the odd dreams, the mysterious voices, and the inexplicable energy he seemed to now wield. He couldn't put a finger on what it all meant, but the nagging feeling that it was somehow linked to the stories about the Ethernodes persisted.

"Who's there?" Corin called out, sensing a disturbance outside. Seraphine didn't answer, but instead pushed open the door and slipped into the room like a wraith. The teenager tensed, his hand instinctively reaching for the knife that lay on the table beside him.

"Be at ease, young one," Seraphine murmured, pulling back her hood to reveal her face. Her eyes held an otherworldly beauty, captivating Corin despite the fear that gripped him. "My name is Seraphine, and I come bearing a message from the Ethereal Council."

"Wh-what do they want with me?" Corin stammered, his grip on the knife tightening.

"Ah," Seraphine replied, her voice lilting like a silken melody. "Now that is a tale best told in its entirety. But first, tell me: have you ever heard of the Ethernodes?"

Corin hesitated, recalling the stories he read about the legendary beings who could wield ethereal energies. "Yes… but what does that have to do with me?"

"Everything," she said simply. "You see, it is believed that you possess the same abilities as those fabled heroes—the power to manipulate the very essence of magic itself."

"Me? But that's impossible!" Corin exclaimed, his heart pounding in his chest. He had felt it before, coursing through him like a tempest, but how did she know about what happened in the wood.

"Is it, though?" Seraphine challenged, her gaze piercing into the very depths of his soul. "The signs are all there, young one. The dreams, the ethereal energy that courses through your veins. You cannot deny the truth any longer."

"How does she know about the dreams?", He thought.

Corin was silent, his mind racing to process the information. He had always dreamed of adventure, of a life beyond the confines of Vernian. But this? This was beyond anything he could have imagined.

"I... I need time to think," he finally said, his voice barely a whisper.

"Of course," Seraphine replied, her tone understanding. "This is a lot to take in. But remember, Corin, destiny waits for no one."

With that, she turned and left, leaving Corin alone with his thoughts. He sat there, the silence of the room pressing down on him. He was an Ethernode. The realization sent a shiver down his spine. His life was about to change, and he wasn't sure if he was ready.

Days turned into nights as Corin grappled with his newfound identity. He spent hours poring over the Ethernode's handbook, trying to make sense of his abilities. He practiced in secret, away from prying eyes, honing his control over the ethereal energy. But with each passing day, the reality of his situation became more apparent.

He was different. He was an Ethernode. And with that came a responsibility he wasn't sure he was ready to shoulder. The thought of leaving Vernian, of leaving his family and friends, filled him with dread. But the call of destiny was too strong to ignore.

One evening, as the sun began to set, painting the sky with hues of orange and pink, Corin found himself standing outside his home, a sense of determination etched on his face. He had made up his mind. He was an Ethernode, and it was time he accepted his destiny.

But he couldn't do it alone. He needed his family. He needed Jonah. They had been his pillars of support, his guiding lights. And he needed them now, more than ever.

With a deep breath, he pushed open the door and stepped inside. His parents were seated at the table, their faces etched with worry. Jonah was there too, his eyes filled with concern.

"I need to talk to you," Corin began, his voice steady. He told them everything - about the ethereal energy, about Seraphine, about his decision to leave Vernian and train as an Ethernode. He watched as a myriad of emotions flashed across their faces - shock, disbelief, fear. But beneath it all, Corin saw something else - understanding.

His parents were silent for a moment, taking in the enormity of their son's revelation. Then, his father spoke. "Corin," he said, his voice filled with emotion. "We always knew you were meant for great things. And while this... this is more than we could have ever imagined, we support you. We always have, and we always will."

His mother nodded, her eyes welling up with tears. "We love you, Corin," she said, reaching out to hold his hand. "And we're proud of you. Always remember that."

Jonah, who had been silent all this while, finally spoke. "You're my best friend, Corin," he said, his voice choked with emotion. "And I'll stand by you, no matter what."

With their words of support and love echoing in his ears, Corin felt a sense of peace wash over him. He wasn't alone. He had his family, his friend. And with them by his side, he could face anything.

The following days were a whirlwind of preparations. Corin spent hours training with Jonah, honing his control over the ethereal energy. His parents helped him pack, their faces a mix of pride and sadness. The villagers, too, lent their support, their initial shock giving way to awe and admiration.

As the day of his departure drew closer, Corin found himself standing at the edge of the Whispering Woods, the same place where he had first encountered Seraphine. He felt a strange sense of déjà vu, his mind filled with memories of their first meeting.

Just as he was about to turn back, he felt a familiar presence. He turned around to find Seraphine standing there, her silver hair glowing under the moonlight. "I knew you would come," she said, her voice as soft as the whispering wind.

Corin nodded, a sense of resolve settling in his heart. "I've made my decision," he said, his voice steady. 

Seraphine studied him for a moment, her eyes twinkling with a secret. "And what might that decision be, Corin Shadowblade?" she asked, her voice filled with anticipation.

Corin took a deep breath, ready to reveal his decision.
