### The Ethernodes Magic System
 
The magic system of Celesterra, known as Ethernodes, is based on the manipulation of ethereal energy, a universal life force that permeates every aspect of the world. This ethereal energy flows through everything, from the land to the creatures, and even the inhabitants themselves.
 
Ethernodes are individuals who have the ability to manipulate this ethereal energy. They use focus stones, unique gems that can channel ethereal energy, to control and shape this energy to their will. The type of focus stone used determines the form of ethereal energy that can be manipulated, such as earth, water, fire, air, and more.
 
The manipulation of ethereal energy is not just a tool or a weapon; it is a sacred act, seen as a way of connecting with the universal life force. The use of ethereal energy influences every aspect of society and the environment, from architecture to education, from economy to politics, creating a world where magic and reality blend seamlessly.
 
The mastery of ethereal energy plays a significant role in society, with Ethernodes often holding high positions. Ethereal energy is governed by the Ethereal Laws, which dictate the acceptable use of this energy. These laws are enforced by the Ethereal Courts, present in each city, with the Ethereal Council in Luminara acting as the highest authority in matters of ethereal law.
 
In essence, Celesterra is a world where the ethereal energy shapes the very fabric of society and the world at large, creating a unique and magical world teeming with life and possibilities.
