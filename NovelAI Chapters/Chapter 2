Chapter 2:

The next morning, Corin woke up with a start. He looked around, confused. Then, he remembered where he was.
His room was small but cozy. The walls were covered in paintings his mother had done of the forest and the stars. His bookshelf was full of books that he had read many times before.
Corin yawned, stretching his arms over his head. Then, he climbed out of bed and got dressed.
Today, he would make his way to Jonah's house. They had planned to meet at his house, where they would discuss what they would do with the rest of their day.
Corin smiled to himself as he left his room, feeling excited about his day with Jonah. He loved their time together. They had always been inseparable, and he could not imagine a life without him.
They had been through a lot together, and Corin would be lost without him.
His thoughts drifted to Elise.
She's just a girl. There's no reason for me to think about her again.
She was just a foolish girl who believed in fairy tales. She didn't know anything about Ethernodes or the world outside Vernian.
"But she does," a voice said, making Corin jump.
"Who's there?" Corin asked, turning around.
"It's me, Elise," the voice replied. "I'm still here."
"Elise?"
"Yes."
Corin frowned, then opened the front door to his home and stepped outside.
He was greeted by a sight that left him speechless. Elise was standing outside his house, wearing the same clothes she had on yesterday. She was smiling at him, and he could see the hope in her eyes.
"What are you doing here?" he asked, shocked.
"I came to see you," she replied. "I wanted to apologize for last night."
Corin nodded. "Okay."
"I should not have lost my temper," she said, fidgeting with her hands. "It was foolish of me to get upset."
"It's okay," Corin said. "I understand."
"You do?"
"Yes."
"Thank you." She paused, then took a step towards him. "Listen, Corin. I want to tell you something."
"What?"
"I'm an Ethernode, too," she said. "I've been one for as long as I can remember."
"Really?"
She nodded. "I'm not the only one."
"What do you mean?"
"There are others," she said. "And they have special powers, just like us. We're all part of a prophecy."
"What prophecy?"
"The one where you save the world from destruction."
"That's crazy," Corin said.
"I know it sounds crazy," Elise replied. "But it's true."
Corin shook his head. "How can you be so sure?"
"Because I'm an Ethernode," Elise said. "And I've heard the prophecy. It's true."
"You're an Ethernode?" he asked. "But that's not possible."
"Why not?"
"Because Ethernodes don't exist," he said. "There are no Ethernodes."
"But there are," Elise said. "They just haven't been seen in centuries."
"That's impossible."
"I know it's hard to believe," she replied, looking into his eyes. "But I promise you, there are Ethernodes. And you're one of them."
Corin was about to speak when his father stepped out of the house.
"There you are, Corin," his father said, smiling. "I was wondering where you had gotten to."
"I'm sorry, Dad," Corin said. "I'll be there in a minute."
"Alright," his father said, turning to look at Elise. "Who's this?"
"This is Elise Skywood," Corin replied. "We used to play together when we were children."
"Hello," Elise said, smiling nervously.
His father smiled back at her. "Welcome to our home."
"Thank you."
"My name is Eric," Corin's father said. "It's nice to meet you."
"It's nice to meet you too, sir," Elise replied.
Eric nodded, then turned back to Corin. "I'll see you later, okay?"
"Okay," Corin said, smiling.
"You better not be late again," his father said. "I won't be happy if I have to come looking for you."
"I won't be late," Corin replied. "I promise."
His father smiled, then turned around and walked back into the house.
Corin looked at Elise. "What are you doing here?"
"I wanted to talk to you," she replied. "I was hoping that we could spend some time together."
"I have to go to Jonah's house," he said. "But maybe later."
"Please," Elise said, taking a step closer. "Just hear me out. I promise I won't take up much of your time."
"Alright," Corin said, sighing. "I'll hear you out. But then I have to go."
"Thank you," she said, beaming. "You won't regret it."
"I better not," Corin muttered, walking away from his house.
Elise followed him, walking beside him silently.
They walked together through the village, passing by other villagers who smiled and waved at them. Corin waved back, smiling awkwardly. He felt uncomfortable, unsure what to say to Elise.
How can I talk to her when I know she's crazy?
But Corin didn't say anything, afraid that he would hurt her feelings. He knew that Elise was a good person and that she meant well, but he couldn't believe her claims about Ethernodes. They were impossible, and he was sure that she had heard about them somewhere.
That's it, he thought, turning to look at Elise. She's a weirdo.
He still could not remember anything about her as a child. She said they played together but Corin could not place any of the memeries.
"What are you thinking about?" Elise asked, frowning.
"Nothing."
"Oh." She paused, then glanced at him. "So, where are we going?"
"Jonah's house," Corin replied.
"Oh." She fell silent, and they continued walking in silence.
Jonah's house was located near the edge of the village, next to the woods. It was small and simple, but it was warm and comfortable.
"Wait here," Corin said, stopping in front of the house. "I'll get him."
"Okay."
He walked up to the front door, knocked, and then opened it.
"Jonah?" Corin called out, stepping inside. "I'm here."
"I'm in the kitchen," Jonah replied.
"I'm coming," Corin said, walking into the kitchen. 
Jonah was sitting at the table, eating breakfast with his mother. They turned to look at Corin, smiling.
"Corin," Jonah's mother said. "Welcome."
"Good morning," Corin said, smiling back at her. "It's good to see you, Mrs. Gainsford."
"Good morning, Corin," Jonah's mother said, laughing. "I'm glad you could make it."
"Corin is my best friend," Jonah said, looking at his mother.
"I know," his mother replied, smiling. "But that doesn't mean I'm not happy to see you."
"I'm happy to see you too," Corin said, glancing at Jonah.
Jonah grinned. "Come and sit down."
"I can't," Corin said. "I have to go."
"Go where?" Jonah's mother asked.
"Elise is here," Corin replied. "I'm going to talk to her."
"Elise?" Jonah's mother asked. "That name does not sound familiar"
"She's just a girl I know," Corin said. "We used to play together when we were children."
"Ah," Jonah's mother said. "How nice."
"I better go," Corin said, turning to Jonah. "I'll see you later."
"Wait," Jonah's mother said. "Let me pack you some food for lunch."
"Thank you," Corin replied. "But I don't think I'll have time to eat it."
"You need to eat something," Jonah's mother insisted, walking towards the pantry. "Just a few bites."
"I promise I'll eat it," Corin said. "I really have to go."
Jonah's mother shook her head, but she said nothing. She handed Corin a basket filled with bread and cheese.
"Thank you," Corin said, taking the basket. "I really appreciate it."
"You're welcome," Jonah's mother said. "Take care."
"I will." Corin turned to Jonah. "I'll see you later."
Jonah nodded. "See you."
Corin smiled, then left the kitchen.
He stepped outside and found Elise standing by the door. She was fidgeting with her hands and had a worried expression on her face.
"Hello," she said, looking up at him. "Is Jonah here?"
"He's eating breakfast with his mother," Corin replied. "But I think he's almost finished."
Elise nodded. "Alright."
"What were you talking about?"
"Nothing," she said, smiling. "It doesn't matter."
"Okay."
They stood there in silence, neither one of them saying anything.
Finally, Jonah stepped out of the house, frowning. "Why did you stop?"
"What do you mean?" Corin asked, surprised.
"Why are you just standing there?" Jonah asked. "What are you waiting for?"
Corin shook his head. "Nothing."
"Come on," Jonah said, walking towards the woods. "Let's go."
"Where are we going?" Elise asked, following Jonah.
"We're going to the cliff," Jonah replied, smiling at her.
"The cliff?" Elise asked.
"Yes."
"What's at the cliff?"
"You'll see."
Elise smiled. "I can't wait."
They walked through the forest in silence, their conversation from earlier still fresh in their minds. Corin felt strange, as if he was betraying Jonah by spending time with Elise, even though she was the one who had come to him.
It's not like we were planning to hang out today, he thought, sighing. I just saw her at the wrong time.
He was starting to regret agreeing to talk to her, but it was too late now. He had made a promise to hear her out, and he intended to keep it.
As they walked through the woods, Corin glanced at Elise and found that she was staring at him with a curious expression on her face. She smiled at him, and he blushed, looking away.
Jonah glanced at Corin, his eyebrows raised. "You okay?"
"Yes," Corin replied, blushing deeper.
"Okay."
Corin walked faster, hoping to put some distance between himself and Elise. But it was no use. She continued to stare at him, making him uncomfortable. He could feel her eyes on him, watching him as they made their way through the woods.
Why is she looking at me? What does she want?
He had no idea how to deal with this situation. He didn't know what to say or do.
What if she's right? What if I am an Ethernode?
He tried to ignore the thoughts, but they continued to bubble up from deep within him. He could not stop himself from thinking about it.
It doesn't make sense. Ethernodes don't exist.
