Chapter Four:

"Are you okay?" Jonah asked, frowning.
"Yeah," Corin said, nodding. "Why do you ask?"
Jonah frowned. "Because you seem distracted."
"I'm fine," Corin replied, shaking his head. "I'm just trying to wrap my mind around this whole thing."
"I know what you mean," Jonah said.
"I don't think I believe it," Corin said. "But at the same time, I do."
"That makes sense," Jonah said. "I can't imagine what it must be like to have such a powerful ability."
"It's not that powerful," Corin said, shaking his head. "I mean, I haven't been able to control it for long."
Elise had left them  and they were now back at Johan's house. Jonah was sitting at the kitchen table while Corin stood next to him, fidgeting with his hands.
"Do you think you'll be able to control it?" Jonah asked. "You know, eventually?"
"I hope so," Corin said. "I mean, if what Elise says is true."
Corin fingered something in his pocket.
Corin, "Jonah, do you remember what she said about focus stones?"
Jonah nodded, frowning. "She said they were special."
"Yeah," Corin said. "She also said something about them being used by Ethernodes."
"What does that mean?"
"I don't know," Corin said. "I guess it means that they're special."
"I guess," Jonah said.
"Do you think this is a focus stone?" Corin said as he pulls a shiny red stone from his pocket. "I found it on the cliff a while back."
"It seemed to pull at me and so I took it home with me." Corin said as he rolled it between his fingers. "Do you think it is related to the strange dreams I have been having?"
"Dreams" asked Jonah. "What do you mean?"
Corin sighed. "I've been having dreams."
"What kind of dreams?"
"They're about the woods, but they're different."
Corin said as he stared at the stone.
Jonah stared at Corin in amazement. "That's amazing."
"I know," Corin said.
"Do you think it has anything to do with the focus stone?"
"It must," Corin said. "Elise said she had a focus stone and that it triggered her Ethernode powers. Maybe that's what is happening to me."
"Are you sure it's not just a dream?"
"I don't know," Corin said. "Maybe it's a combination of both."
"How could it be a combination of a dream and the focus stone?"
Corin shrugged, then handed the stone to Jonah. "Maybe you should hold it."
"Why?"
"I want to see if you have any special abilities."
Jonah rolled his eyes. "You're so full of it."
"You never know," Corin said, smiling. "It's possible."
Jonah rolled his eyes again but took the stone anyway.
He stared at the stone as he held it in his hand. Then, he closed his eyes.
"Anything?" Corin asked, watching him.
"No," Jonah said. "Nothing."
"Huh," Corin said, frowning. "Well, I guess it's not for you."
"I guess not," Jonah said.
"What should we do now?"
"I don't know," Jonah said, shaking his head. "I mean, there is so much to talk about."
"It's all just so unbelievable," Corin said, sighing. "I can't believe it."
"Yeah," Jonah said. "But it's true. You're an Ethernode."
"What does that mean?"
"It means you have powers," Jonah said. "And it means that we're part of a prophecy."
"Maybe?" Corin said, shaking his head.
The next day Corin awoke with a pounding at his front door. He stared at the ceiling, blinking sleep from his eyes. The knocking continued as he pulled himself out of bed.
"Coming," he mumbled, walking towards the door.
"Who is it?" he called out, reaching for the handle.
"It's me," a voice called. "Elise."
Corin frowned, then opened the door. "Elise?"
"Good morning," Elise said, smiling. "I came to see you."
"I see that," Corin said.
Elise walked into the house, following him into the kitchen. Corin looked around but saw no sign of his mother.
"Where's my mother?" he asked.
Elise shook her head. "How should I know?"
Corin glared at her. "You're right. I'm sorry."
Elise laughed. "I'm just joking."
"I saw her leave for the market, so this is the perfect time for us to talk."
"Okay," Corin said. "What do you want to talk about?"
"Your focus stone," she replied. "And what it means for you."
Corin sighed, then took out the focus stone from his pocket. "I have a question."
"What is it?" replied Elise.
"I found this stone in the woods," he said, showing it to her. 
"Where did you find it?" she asked.
"It was on the cliff," he replied. "I found it a few weeks ago."
"Was anyone with you?" she asked, frowning.
"No," he said. "I was alone."
"What happened then?"
"I found it on the ground," he said, shaking his head. "I guess it's been there a while. It's not shiny anymore."
"What did you do when you found it?" she asked.
"I picked it up," he said.
"Do you remember what happened next?"
Corin nodded. "Yes. It felt like it was calling to me. I couldn't resist it."
"What happened next?"
"I brought it home with me," he said. "And I put it in my pocket."
"But it didn't react," she said, frowning.
Corin shook his head. "No. Not until yesterday."
"What happened yesterday?" she asked.
"I was playing with the focus stone," he said. "I thought that maybe it would respond to my touch. And it did."
Elise stared at the stone. "It did?"
"Yes." Corin said, nodding. "When I touched it, it started to glow."
"That must be what I was feeling," Elise said, frowning. "It felt like something was calling out to me."
"I know," Corin said, smiling. "I felt the same thing."
"What else did you do?" she asked.
"Nothing," he replied. "I just kept it in my pocket."
"What about your dreams?" Elise said as she investigated Corin's eyes. "Have they been unusual, more vivid, almost real?"
"Yes," he said, nodding. "I think so."
"I'm not sure," Elise said, frowning. "But I think it's a sign."
"What does it mean?" Corin asked.
"I think you're an Ethernode," Elise said, her eyes sparkling. "The stone is calling out to you, begging for you to use it."
"When an Ethernode first awake they will have dreams. These dreams along with the discovery of a focus stone are the first signs of a new Ethernode." Elise explained.
"Why is that?"
"Because the focus stone is special," she said. "It's the key to awakening your powers."
"And what if I'm not an Ethernode?" Corin said, frowning.
Elise shook her head. "You're an Ethernode. I can feel it."
"How can you be sure?"
"Because you have a focus stone," Elise said, taking out a focus stone.
It was an emerald green stone, and Corin stared at it, mesmerized. He could feel the energy radiating from it. It was not calling to him like his red stone does but it does have a feeling of power.
He took a deep breath, feeling the energy flowing through his body.
"How is it possible?" he asked. "How can something like this exist?"
"I don't know," Elise replied. "It just does."
Corin stared at her, frowning. "That's not an answer."
"I know," she said, shaking her head. "But it's all I have."
"What about your powers?" Corin asked.
"I've had them for as long as I can remember," Elise replied. "I've always been sensitive to ethereal energy, even before I found my focus stone."
"How old are you?" Corin asked. "I mean, how long have you been able to do this?"
"I think I'm seventeen," she said. "But I'm not really sure."
"When I was a child, I had awakened my power. That was when I found my stone in the Whispering Woods. It was then an envoy from the Ethereal Council came. They had felt my awakening. They have a way of feeling it. The envoy took me to the city of Luminara in the Celestial Empire. There I was enrolled at the Ethereal Academy." Elise said "I am still in my first year there. The Council felt your awakening and seeing that I am from this town, they sent me here as your envoy."
"Wait," Corin said, frowning. "Ethereal Council? Ethereal Academy? What are you talking about?"
"I told you," Elise said. "I'm an Ethernode."
"The focus stone is just the first step," Elise said, frowning. "You need more than that to awaken."
"How much more?"
Elise shook her head. "I don't know."
"What do you mean you don't know?"
"I mean, I don't know," Elise said, her eyes sparkling. "You have to understand, this is all new to me. I awakened so young that it was dangerous for me to start my training." 
"This is my first year of real training. I have only been at the academy for three months." said Elise as she paced the room. "And I still don't really know what I am doing."
"But you've been practicing?"
"Yes," she said. "But it's not like I'm an expert."
"That doesn't matter," Corin said, frowning. "You have powers."
Elise shook her head. "No. It doesn't matter."
"It doesn't?"
"I have been practicing for three months and I can do basic things like move small objects, make an ether orb, and create small jolts of energies." Elise said, frowning.
"It's not much, but I'm still learning how to control it. The Council has assigned me a tutor who is helping me with my training." Elise said, shaking her head.
"My tutor is also teaching me how to control the ethereal energies better."
Corin nodded, "And I guess you want me to come with you so that I can start my training?"
"Yes," Elise said. "I think you should."
"Why me?"
"Because you are an Ethernode," Elise said, frowning. "And we have a prophecy about Ethernodes saving the world."
"From what?" Corin asked. "The war?"
"The war," Elise said. "But it's more than just the war."
"How do you know so much?" Corin asked. "About this prophecy and the Council and all of this."
"I told you, I awakened early." she said. "I was not able to train but I was able to learn about the histories."
"So, you believe it?" Corin asked.
"I do," she said. "And so should you."
"Why?" proclaimed Corin.
"Because it's true," she said. "It's happening now, and it's happening to you."
"Okay," Corin said. "I guess I have no choice but to believe you."
"That's right," Elise said. "It's happening."
"So, what now?" he asked.
"What do you mean?" she replied.
"I mean, how does it happen? What do I do?"
"First, you need to come with me," she said. "To Luminara."
"Where is that?" Corin asked.
"It's in the Celestial Empire," she said. "Just outside of this region of the world. It will be a few days journey."
"It will?" Corin asked, frowning. "I thought you said it was close."
"It is close," Elise said. "But it's a journey to get there."
"You're coming with me?" Corin asked.
"Yes," she said. "I'm your envoy."
"You're my what?" Corin asked.
"I'm your envoy," she said. "It means I'm supposed to look after you."
"But I don't need anyone to look after me," he protested.
"I know," she said, shaking her head. "But it's your destiny."
"What about Jonah?" Corin asked.
"What about him?"
"He's my friend," Corin said.
"I know," Elise said. "But he can't come with us."
"Why not?"
"He's not an Ethernode," she said. 
"That does not matter." Said Corin. "We have been dreaming of leaving this village for ages. This is our chance. I am not leaving without asking him. He is my 'best friend'."
"If you think so," she said. "It's your choice."
