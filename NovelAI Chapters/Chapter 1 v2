Chapter 1:

Upon the edge of a modest precipice, Corin Shadowblade stood, his gaze sweeping across the humble village of Vernian. Nestled within the heart of the dense forest, the village seemed a natural outgrowth of the verdant landscape, its thatched roofs and wooden walls sprouting organically from the earth. He inhaled deeply, the crisp, earthy scent of the woods filling his lungs, a familiar comfort. His family's dwelling sat on the outskirts of the village, where his father, a blacksmith of notable skill, crafted weapons and tools for the community, while his mother nurtured a thriving vegetable garden.

Vernian was home to a mere two hundred souls, including Corin himself. Yet, to him, it was a bustling metropolis, a world unto itself. His gaze drifted to the sky, painted in brilliant hues of orange and pink as the sun cast its final rays upon the day. The sight calmed his restless heart, which had been beating with an uncharacteristic rapidity.

"It's beautiful," Corin whispered to the wind, leaning against the rough stone of the cliff. The village of Vernian was everything he'd ever known and more. It was a haven of peace, a sanctuary of comfort. He could spend the rest of his days here, content in the rhythm of village life, and meet death as an old friend. He loved this place with every fiber of his being, every beat of his heart.

Yet, beneath the tranquility of his life, a longing stirred. A yearning for more. More adventure, more freedom, more excitement. He dreamed of the world beyond Vernian, of the sights he would see, the experiences he would have, the endless possibilities that lay beyond the confines of the forest. His best friend Jonah often likened Corin to a squirrel, forever curious, forever exploring, but Corin cared not. The unknown called to him, a siren's song he could not ignore.

As he stood on the precipice, gazing down at Vernian, an almost irresistible urge seized him. To jump. To cast aside the shackles of his life in a single, dramatic gesture and leap headfirst into the unknown. "Are you coming, Corin?" Jonah's voice broke through his reverie, the familiar timbre grounding him. "The others are waiting for us."

"I'm coming," Corin replied, tearing his gaze away from the precipice. He couldn't bring himself to jump, but it had been a close call. "You're so dramatic," Jonah laughed as they made their way back to their friends. "I'm just trying to make the most of my life," Corin retorted, a smile playing on his lips.

They spent the remainder of the evening speaking of the future, of the adventures they would embark upon once they were of age to travel beyond the forest. Corin dreamed of the world beyond Vernian. He yearned to explore the grand cities of the Celestial Empire, to traverse the vast oceans and the endless deserts, to immerse himself in the myriad cultures of the world.

Jonah, however, was content to remain in Vernian. He loved his village and its inhabitants. He was a beacon of loyalty and honesty, and Corin loved him for that. "I don't know what I would do without you," Jonah confessed, his gaze meeting Corin's. "I'd probably die," Corin quipped, earning a playful shove from Jonah. "Very funny."

"I'm serious," Corin insisted, his smile fading. "We've been through a lottogether. If it wasn't for you, I don't know where I would be."

Jonah's brow furrowed, confusion clouding his blue eyes. "What do you mean?"

Corin's smile faded as he met Jonah's gaze. "I mean that you've been a great friend and a great confidant. I've always been able to rely on you when I needed someone to talk to."

"Corin..."

Corin reached out and took Jonah's hand in his, his gaze never leaving Jonah's. "I don't know where I would be if it wasn't for you."

Jonah remained silent, his expression unreadable. Corin averted his gaze, the silence stretching between them becoming unbearable. "Anyway, I should get going." He rose, turning back to Jonah. "Are we still on for tomorrow?"

Jonah nodded, though his heart didn't seem to be in it. "See you later," Corin said, then walked away from Jonah and toward the edge of the woods.

"Where are you going?" Jonah called after him.

"I'm going to the forest," Corin replied. "I need to clear my head."

Jonah shook his head, his expression thoughtful. "The forest? But why?"

"I don't know," Corin said, turning back to look at Jonah. "I just need to go there. I need to be alone for a while."

Jonah opened his mouth, as though he wanted to say something, but then closed it again. "I'll see you tomorrow," Corin said, disappearing into the woods. Jonah nodded and waved goodbye.

Corin turned back and waved to him. Then, he stepped into the forest and disappeared from sight.

The sun was beginning to set when Corin finally emerged from the Whispering Woods. The light was fading, but he could see well enough. He was covered in sweat and dirt, and his hair was a mess.

He hadn't meant to spend the entire day in the forest. He had just wanted to get away and think. He took a deep breath, then exhaled loudly. He felt better, but he still didn't know what he was going to do. He was lost and confused. He felt as if he was on the verge of something huge, something life changing.

He wasn't sure if it was good or bad, but it definitely was not normal. His heart was beating fast, his head was pounding, and his body felt like it was on fire. He could feel something inside him, something new.

What was happening to him?

"Hello?" a voice said, snapping him out of his reverie. "Corin? Is that you?"

He looked up to see a young girl standing before him, her expression filled with surprise. She was small and thin, with brown hair and hazel eyes. Her face was smeared with dirt, and she was dressed in a simple, roughspun shirt and pants.

"Who are you?" he asked, stepping forward.

"It's me, Elise," she said, smiling at him. "Elise Skywood. We used to play together when we were younger."

Corin gasped. "Elise!" He had almost forgotten about her.

Elise had always been a quiet girl, rarely talking to anyone except her best friend. She had been shy and introverted, but Corin had never found her annoying.

"What are you doing here?" he asked, curious.

"I was looking for you," Elise said, staring at him with wide eyes. "I've been looking for you all day."

"Why?"

"Because I have something to tell you," Elise said, biting her lower lip nervously. "Something important."

"What is it?"

"It'sa secret," she said, taking a step forward. "Can you keep a secret?"

"Yes."

Elise smiled. "Good. Because this secret is going to change your life forever."

"How do you know that?" Corin asked, suddenly intrigued.

"I just know," she said, staring into his eyes. "It's going to be the biggest secret you've ever heard."

Corin hesitated. "What kind of secret?"

"The best kind," Elise said. "It's a secret about..." She paused, then looked around before leaning in close. "Ethernodes."

Corin frowned. "Ethernodes?"

"Yes," Elise whispered. "You're one of them."

"What?"

"You're an Ethernode," Elise repeated, her expression serious.

Corin laughed, then stopped when he realized that she wasn't joking. "You're not serious, right?"

"Of course I'm serious," Elise said, taking a step back. "Don't you believe me?"

"No," Corin replied.

Elise glared at him. "Why not?"

"Because it's stupid," he said. "There are no Ethernodes."

"I'm telling you, there are," Elise insisted.

"Whatever." Corin turned away from her. "I'm leaving."

"Wait," Elise said.

"What now?"

"I'm telling you, you're an Ethernode," she repeated. "Just listen to me, okay?"

"Fine."

"You have special abilities," Elise said. "You can control the elements."

Corin frowned. "The elements?"

"Yes," Elise replied, smiling. "You can control the wind, the fire, the water..."

"Stop," Corin said, cutting her off. "You're insane."

"I'm not insane," Elise said. "It's true."

"It's not true."

"Why don't you believe me?" she asked. "Do you think I'm lying?"

"No."

"Well, then."

"Look, I've got to go," Corin said.

"But I haven't told you about the prophecy," Elise said. "About how you're going to save the world."

"Save the world?" Corin asked, frowning.

Elise nodded. "Yes."

"From what?"

"From the war."

"What war?"

"The one that's coming," Elise replied. "The one that's going to destroy the Celestial Empire."

"That's ridiculous," Corin scoffed. "There's no war."

"You don't know that," Elise said. "It could be happening right now."

Corin shook his head. "There's no war."

Elise stared at him, her expression filled with pain. "You don't believe me," she whispered.

"I'm sorry," Corin said, feeling guilty.

"I should go," Elise said. She turned and walked away, her back stiff.

"Elise!" Corin called out.

She ignored him, disappearing into the woods.

Corin stood there, watching her go. He felt awful. He had upset her, but he didn't understand what had happened. One minute, she was talking nonsense, and the next, she was upset.

She said we used to play together when we were younger, but I still have no memory of her. Who was she really? How did she know where I was?

How could he have been so blind?

"Elise," he called out again, but it was no use. She was gone.

He sighed, then turned away from the woods and began to walk home.

As Corin stepped into his house, he was greeted by the familiar scent of his mother's cooking. His stomach growled, reminding him that he had not eaten anything since breakfast.

"You'relate," his mother said, not looking up from the pot she was stirring. "Where have you been?"

"I was in the forest," Corin replied, taking off his boots.

"Again?" His mother sighed. "You spend too much time in there. It's not safe."

"I know," Corin said, sitting down at the table. "I just needed some time alone."

His mother nodded, understanding. "Well, dinner's almost ready. Go wash up."

Corin nodded and headed to the washroom. As he washed his hands, he couldn't help but think about Elise. Her words echoed in his mind, filling him with a sense of unease.

He shook his head, trying to clear his mind. He was probably just overthinking things. Elise was just a girl, after all. She couldn't possibly know anything about Ethernodes or prophecies.

Could she?

As he sat down to eat, Corin couldn't help but feel a sense of unease. He tried to push it aside, to focus on his meal, but it was no use. His mind kept drifting back to Elise and her words.

He was an Ethernode. He was going to save the world.

It was ridiculous. It was impossible.

But what if it wasn't?

What if Elise was right?

What if he really was an Ethernode?

What if he was the only one who could save the world?

Corin shook his head, trying to clear his mind. It was no use. He couldn't stop thinking about it.

He was an Ethernode.

He was going to save the world.

And there was nothing he could do to change it.

As he finished his meal, Corin couldn't help but feel a sense of dread. He was an Ethernode. He was going to save the world.

And he had no idea how to do it.
