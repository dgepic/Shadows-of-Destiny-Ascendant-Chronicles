Chapter 1:

Corin Shadowblade stood on the precipice of a small cliff, his gaze sweeping over the village of Vernian. Nestled amongst the dense forest, its thatched roofs and wooden walls seemed to sprout organically from the verdant landscape. He inhaled deeply, the crisp, earthy scent of the woods filling his lungs. His family's modest dwelling sat on the outskirts of the village, where his father, a skilled blacksmith, crafted weapons and tools for the community, while his mother nurtured a thriving vegetable garden.
The village was home to a mere two hundred residents, including himself. Yet, to Corin, it seemed like a bustling metropolis. His gaze drifted to the sky, which was painted in brilliant shades of orange and pink, the sun's final rays illuminating the skyline. The sight calmed his restless heart, which had been beating rapidly all day.
"It's beautiful," Corin whispered, leaning against the cliff.
Vernian was everything he'd ever known and more. It was safe, peaceful, and comfortable. He could spend the rest of his life here and die a happy man. He loved this place with every fiber of his being.
However, despite the tranquility of his life, he longed for more. More adventure, more freedom, more excitement. He dreamed of seeing the world outside Vernian. He dreamed of the things he would see and the experiences he would have. He dreamed of the possibilities that lay beyond the forest.
His best friend Jonah often joked that Corin was a squirrel who never tired of exploring, but Corin didn't care. He would always be drawn to the unknown.
As he stood on the cliff, gazing down at Vernian, Corin felt an almost irresistible urge to jump. To end his life in the most dramatic way possible and to leap headfirst into the unknown.
"Are you coming, Corin?" Jonah asked, standing next to him. "The others are waiting for us."
"I'm coming," Corin replied, turning away from the cliff. He couldn't bring himself to jump, but it had been a close call.
"You're so dramatic," Jonah laughed as they walked back to their friends.
"I'm just trying to make the most of my life," Corin said, smiling back at him.
They spent the rest of the evening talking about the future and what adventures they would go on once they were old enough to travel outside the forest. Corin dreamed of seeing the world beyond Vernian. He wanted to go to the cities of the Celestial Empire, explore the oceans and the deserts, and see what other cultures were like.
Jonah, however, was content to remain in Vernian. He loved his village and its inhabitants. He was loyal and honest, and Corin loved him for that.
"I don't know what I would do without you," Jonah said, staring into Corin's eyes.
"I'd probably die," Corin joked.
Jonah laughed and playfully shoved him. "Very funny."
"I'm serious," Corin said, smiling back at him. "We've been through a lot together. If it wasn't for you, I don't know where I would be."
Jonah frowned. "What do you mean?"
Corin's smile faded as he stared into Jonah's blue eyes, which were filled with confusion. "I mean that you've been a great friend and a great confidant. I've always been able to rely on you when I needed someone to talk to."
"Corin..."
Corin reached out and took Jonah's hand in his, gazing deeply into his eyes. "I don't know where I would be if it wasn't for you."
Jonah didn't say anything, his expression unreadable.
Corin averted his gaze, unable to bear the silence any longer. "Anyway, I should get going." He stood up, then turned back to look at Jonah. "Are we still on for tomorrow?"
Jonah nodded, though it was obvious his heart wasn't in it.
"See you later," Corin said, then walked away from Jonah and toward the edge of the woods.
"Where are you going?" Jonah called out after him.
"I'm going to the forest," Corin replied. "I need to clear my head."
Jonah shook his head, his expression thoughtful. "The forest? But why?"
"I don't know," Corin said, turning back to look at Jonah. "I just need to go there. I need to be alone for a while."
Jonah opened his mouth, as though he wanted to say something, but then closed it again.
"I'll see you tomorrow," Corin said, walking into the woods.
Jonah nodded and waved goodbye.
Corin turned back and waved to him. Then, he stepped into the forest and disappeared from sight.
The sun was beginning to set when Corin finally emerged from the Whispering Woods. The light was fading, but he could see well enough. He was covered in sweat and dirt, and his hair was a mess.
He hadn't meant to spend the entire day in the forest. He had just wanted to get away and think.
He took a deep breath, then exhaled loudly. He felt better, but he still didn't know what he was going to do. He was lost and confused. He felt as if he was on the verge of something huge, something life changing.
He wasn't sure if it was good or bad, but it definitely was not normal. His heart was beating fast, his head was pounding, and his body felt like it was on fire. He could feel something inside him, something new.
What was happening to him?
"Hello?" a voice said, snapping him out of his reverie. "Corin? Is that you?"
He looked up to see a young girl standing before him, her expression filled with surprise. She was small and thin, with brown hair and hazel eyes. Her face was smeared with dirt, and she was dressed in a simple, roughspun shirt and pants.
"Who are you?" he asked, stepping forward.
"It's me, Elise," she said, smiling at him. "Elise Skywood. We used to play together when we were younger."
Corin gasped. "Elise!" He had almost forgotten about her.
Elise had always been a quiet girl, rarely talking to anyone except her best friend. She had been shy and introverted, but Corin had never found her annoying.
"What are you doing here?" he asked, curious.
"I was looking for you," Elise said, staring at him with wide eyes. "I've been looking for you all day."
"Why?"
"Because I have something to tell you," Elise said, biting her lower lip nervously. "Something important."
"What is it?"
"It's a secret," she said, taking a step forward. "Can you keep a secret?"
"Yes."
Elise smiled. "Good. Because this secret is going to change your life forever."
"How do you know that?" Corin asked, suddenly intrigued.
"I just know," she said, staring into his eyes. "It's going to be the biggest secret you've ever heard."
Corin hesitated. "What kind of secret?"
"The best kind," Elise said. "It's a secret about..." She paused, then looked around before leaning in close. "Ethernodes."
Corin frowned. "Ethernodes?"
"Yes," Elise whispered. "You're one of them."
"What?"
"You're an Ethernode," Elise repeated, her expression serious.
Corin laughed, then stopped when he realized that she wasn't joking. "You're not serious, right?"
"Of course I'm serious," Elise said, taking a step back. "Don't you believe me?"
"No," Corin replied.
Elise glared at him. "Why not?"
"Because it's stupid," he said. "There are no Ethernodes."
"I'm telling you, there are," Elise insisted.
"Whatever." Corin turned away from her. "I'm leaving."
"Wait," Elise said.
"What now?"
"I'm telling you, you're an Ethernode," she repeated. "Just listen to me, okay?"
"Fine."
"You have special abilities," Elise said. "You can control the elements."
Corin frowned. "The elements?"
"Yes," Elise replied, smiling. "You can control the wind, the fire, the water..."
"Stop," Corin said, cutting her off. "You're insane."
"I'm not insane," Elise said. "It's true."
"It's not true."
"Why don't you believe me?" she asked. "Do you think I'm lying?"
"No."
"Well, then."
"Look, I've got to go," Corin said.
"But I haven't told you about the prophecy," Elise said. "About how you're going to save the world."
"Save the world?" Corin asked, frowning.
Elise nodded. "Yes."
"From what?"
"From the war."
"What war?"
"The one that's coming," Elise replied. "The one that's going to destroy the Celestial Empire."
"That's ridiculous," Corin scoffed. "There's no war."
"You don't know that," Elise said. "It could be happening right now."
Corin shook his head. "There's no war."
Elise stared at him, her expression filled with pain. "You don't believe me," she whispered.
"I'm sorry," Corin said, feeling guilty.
"I should go," Elise said. She turned and walked away, her back stiff.
"Elise!" Corin called out.
She ignored him, disappearing into the woods.
Corin stood there, watching her go. He felt awful. He had upset her, but he didn't understand what had happened. One minute, she was talking nonsense, and the next, she was upset.
She said we used to play together when we were younger, but I still have no memory of her. Who was she really? How did she know where I was?
How could he have been so blind?
"Elise," he called out again, but it was no use. She was gone.
He sighed, then turned away from the woods and began to walk home.
As Corin stepped into his house, he was greeted by the familiar scent of his mother's cooking. His stomach growled, reminding him that he had not eaten anything since breakfast.
"You're home early," his mother said, turning to smile at him. "Dinner's almost ready."
"I'm not hungry," Corin replied.
His mother frowned. "What's wrong?"
Corin shook his head. "It's nothing."
"Is it Jonah?" his mother asked.
"No."
His mother turned back to the stove, her expression grim. "I've told you about that boy."
"I know," Corin said, sighing.
His mother was a gentle woman who had given birth to three children, two sons and a daughter. She loved her family dearly and was fiercely protective of them. She had been married to his father for more than twenty years and had spent most of her life in Vernian, never leaving the forest.
As for Corin's father, he was a kind, caring man who had once been a part of the city guard but had quit due to a lingering injury. He was not as tall as Corin, but he was strong and powerful. Corin loved his father dearly.
"I know you're worried about him," Corin said, stepping closer. "But he'll be fine. He always is."
"I just want to protect you," his mother said, turning back to him. "From everything."
"I know," Corin replied. "But there's nothing to worry about."
"How can you be sure?"
"Because Jonah has been my friend since we were children," Corin said. "We've gone through a lot together. And I know he's there for me. He would never hurt me."
His mother smiled. "I'm glad to hear it."
"I'm going to get changed," he said, walking towards the bedroom. "I need to get out of this sweaty clothes."
"Okay," she said. "Dinner will be ready in a minute."
"Thanks," he replied, closing the door behind him.
He was in desperate need of a bath and some time alone. His conversation with Elise had left him unsettled, and he didn't know what to do.
Who is she? How does she know about me?
Corin knew that she was young, but he was even more curious about how she had managed to track him down.
There's no way she could have found me on her own, he thought, pulling off his shirt. She must have help.
He had always been a solitary soul, preferring to keep to himself rather than interact with others. He did not make friends easily, and those he had were special.
I'm just too curious for my own good, he thought, stepping out of his pants. I should have just ignored her.
Corin frowned, remembering the look on Elise's face when he had told her he didn't believe her. He had never seen such sorrow before, and he could feel her pain. It was like she was a wounded animal, lashing out in fear.
"I should have been more careful," he muttered.
He wondered what else she had said. He had not paid attention to her words, only her voice. It was clear and melodious, like a crystal bell.
She must be from Vernian, he thought, climbing into bed. Her family has probably heard rumors about Ethernodes.
That had to be it. Elise was a naive girl who had mistaken him for something more. She had likely heard rumors of Ethernodes, but that didn't mean she knew anything about them.
I wonder how old she is, he thought, lying back on the bed. She doesn't seem too different from me, but she seems younger.
It was strange to think about her like this, but he could not help it. He was curious about her.
Why was she so convinced about the Ethernodes? Where had she heard such things?
