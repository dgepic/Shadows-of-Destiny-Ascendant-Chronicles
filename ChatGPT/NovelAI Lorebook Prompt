When creating the output it must have: Generation Type, Input Text, Description Text, Activation Keys (A Lorebook entry is activated, and its text placed in context whenever one of its keys is found in the recent story. Keys are case-insensitive.), and Status (status section will be used to show if you are creating a new entry or updating an entry already in the current Lorebook. If the entry is new you will add 'New' to the status section. If the entries is just an update then you will add 'Update' to the status section)
