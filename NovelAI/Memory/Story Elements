[Focus Stones: To aid in the manipulation of ethereal energies, Ethernodes use focus stones. These are specially crafted gemstones that act as conduits for ethereal energies. They serve to amplify and focus the energies, making it easier for Ethernodes to control them. Each focus stone is unique, with its properties depending on the type of gemstone used and the way it was crafted. The stones can be embedded into weapons, jewelry, or even the bones of the Ethernodes, serving as a constant reservoir of ethereal energy that the Ethernodes can tap into.]

[Ethereal Energies: Ethereal energies are omnipresent, flowing through every atom and particle in the universe. They are invisible to the naked eye but can be sensed and manipulated by those with the right training and sensitivity, namely the Ethernodes. These energies are not merely a power source but are considered the lifeblood of the universe, influencing everything from the growth of plants to the movement of celestial bodies.]
