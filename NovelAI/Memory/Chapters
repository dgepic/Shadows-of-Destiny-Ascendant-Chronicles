[Chapter One: Vernian village is peaceful, nestled in dense forest. Corin Shadowblade lives here, son of a blacksmith and a gardener. Vernian has around 200 residents. Corin dreams of adventure beyond Vernian. Corin's best friend is Jonah, who is content with life in Vernian. Corin has a moment of contemplation on a cliff, considering the unknown. Corin spends time in the Whispering Woods to clear his mind. Corin meets Elise Skywood, a girl from his past, in the forest. Elise reveals a secret to Corin, claiming he is an Ethernode, a being with the ability to control elements. Elise also mentions a prophecy about Corin saving the world from a war. Corin is skeptical about Elise's claims. Corin returns home to his mother's cooking, his family is protective and caring. Corin is left contemplating about Elise's claims and her knowledge about him.]

[Chapter Two: Corin wakes up in his cozy room, filled with his mother's paintings and his favorite books. He plans to spend the day with his best friend, Jonah. As he leaves his house, he finds Elise waiting for him outside. Elise apologizes for her outburst the previous night and reveals that she too is an Ethernode. Corin's father, Eric, meets Elise and welcomes her warmly. Despite his plans with Jonah, Corin agrees to hear Elise out. They walk through the village and head towards Jonah's house. Jonah's mother packs lunch for Corin, who then introduces Elise to Jonah. The trio head to the cliff, a peaceful spot Corin and Jonah often visit. Elise reveals a gemstone, a focus stone, that she claims can help control ethereal energies. She insists that Corin is an Ethernode, a claim that Jonah finds hard to believe. Elise shares that she found the focus stone in the Whispering Woods and that it triggered her Ethernode abilities. She decides to demonstrate how the focus stone works.]

[Chapter Three: Corin, Jonah, and Elise reach the cliff around noon. The cliff is a peaceful place that Corin and Jonah often visit. Elise reveals that she brought them there to show them something. She pulls out a gemstone, which she calls a 'focus stone', and claims it allows the holder to control ethereal energies. Elise insists that Corin is an Ethernode, a being with the ability to manipulate elements. Jonah is skeptical and believes Ethernodes are a myth. Elise explains that she found the focus stone in the Whispering Woods when she was young and that it triggered her abilities as an Ethernode. She demonstrates her power by making a stick float using ethereal energy. Corin is amazed but unsure, while Jonah remains skeptical and expresses distrust towards Elise. Corin decides to go home, still processing the information. Elise thanks Corin for believing her.]

[Chapter 4: Elise explains the existence of the Ethereal Council, a group that can sense when a new Ethernode awakens. This knowledge led Elise back to Vernian. Elise reveals that the strange dreams Corin has been experiencing are a sign of an Ethernode's awakening. The focus stone is discussed further, with Elise explaining its role in an Ethernode's awakening. Corin is left contemplating the revelations of the day and the potential of his newfound abilities as an Ethernode.]
